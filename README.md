# Hidden Markov Models

This repository ports over several functions from the R package `HMM` to Python.

Functions:

1. `backward`: Computes the backward probabilities
2. `forward`: Computes the forward probabilities
3. `viterbi`: Computes the most probable path of states
4. `posterior`: Computes the posterior probabilities for the states
